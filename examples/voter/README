Erlvolt 01./alpha - README of Voter sample

Erlang client version of VoltDB "Voter" example application.

These samples works with the catalog and server of the Java example in
<voltdb>/examples/voter.

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Tested with Erlang 13B-1 and Java 1.6.0-17.
 * Erlang 12B-4 may be a minimum. 
 * Java 1.6.0-18 is recommend anyway by VoltDB.
 * Compile and run the /Java/ voter sample

 
Running Samples
---------------

You should get the Java samples in <voltdb>/examples/voter to run first to
have the VoltDB server that you need for the Erlang examples here.

To run the examples in this folder, *start* the VoltDB server that you built 
with said Java example, go into this folder here with a seperate terminal
(>erlvolt</examples/voter) and from the command line run 

$> erlc ../../erlvolt.erl
$> erlc voterclient.erl 
$> erl -s voterclient run -s init stop -noshell

This will initialize the database (if needed) and run a simulation of
voting.  At the end of the execution it will display the winning contestant
and the number of transactions per second.
